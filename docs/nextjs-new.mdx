  - How to add Clerk to your Next.js application
  - Use Clerk's prebuilt components for user authentication
</TutorialHero>

<Steps>
  ## Create a new Next.js application

  Run the following command to create a new Next.js application:

  ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
  npx create-next-app@latest
  ```

  Accept the default configuration options when prompted.

  ## Install `@clerk/nextjs`

  Run the following command to install the Next.js SDK:

  <CodeBlockTabs options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    npm install @clerk/nextjs@6.11.0-snapshot.v20250124164901
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    yarn add @clerk/nextjs@6.11.0-snapshot.v20250124164901
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    pnpm add @clerk/nextjs@6.11.0-snapshot.v20250124164901
    ```
  </CodeBlockTabs>

  ## Add `clerkMiddleware()` to your app

  1. Create a `middleware.ts` file.
     - If you're using the `/src` directory, create `middleware.ts` in the `/src` directory.
     - If you're not using the `/src` directory, create `middleware.ts` in the root directory.
  1. In your `middleware.ts` file, export the `clerkMiddleware()` helper:

     ```tsx {{ filename: 'middleware.ts' }}
     import { clerkMiddleware } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

     export default clerkMiddleware()

     export const config = {
       matcher: [
         // Skip Next.js internals and all static files, unless found in search params
         '/((?!_next|[^?]*\\.(?:html?|css|js(?!on)|jpe?g|webp|png|gif|svg|ttf|woff2?|ico|csv|docx?|xlsx?|zip|webmanifest)).*)',
         // Always run for API routes
         '/(api|trpc)(.*)',
       ],
     }
     ```
  1. By default, `clerkMiddleware()` will not protect any routes. All routes are public and you must opt-in to protection for routes. See the [`clerkMiddleware()` reference](/docs/references/nextjs/clerk-middleware) to learn how to require authentication for specific routes.

  ## Add `<ClerkProvider>` and Clerk components to your app

  1. Add the `<ClerkProvider>` component to your app's layout. This component provides Clerk's authentication context to your app.
  1. Add Clerk's prebuilt components to create a header with sign-in button.

  > [!NOTE]
  > This is the default `layout.tsx` file generated by Next.js with Clerk's components added. Feel free to copy and paste the whole file into your project.

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/layout.tsx', mark: [[2, 9], 34, [37, 45], 49] }}
  import type { Metadata } from 'next'
  import {
    ClerkProvider,
    SignInButton,
    SignUpButton,
    SignedIn,
    SignedOut,
    UserButton,
  } from '@clerk/nextjs'
  import { Geist, Geist_Mono } from 'next/font/google'
  import './globals.css'

  const geistSans = Geist({
    variable: '--font-geist-sans',
    subsets: ['latin'],
  })

  const geistMono = Geist_Mono({
    variable: '--font-geist-mono',
    subsets: ['latin'],
  })

  export const metadata: Metadata = {
    title: 'Clerk Next.js Quickstart',
    description: 'Generated by create next app',
  }

  export default function RootLayout({
    children,
  }: Readonly<{
    children: React.ReactNode
  }>) {
    return (
      <ClerkProvider>
        <html lang="en">
          <body className={`${geistSans.variable} ${geistMono.variable} antialiased`}>
            <header className="flex justify-end items-center p-4 gap-4 h-16">
              <SignedOut>
                <SignInButton />
                <SignUpButton />
              </SignedOut>
              <SignedIn>
                <UserButton />
              </SignedIn>
            </header>
            {children}
          </body>
        </html>
      </ClerkProvider>
    )
  }
  ```

  ## Go through the sign-up flow to create your first user

  Run your project with the following command:

  <CodeBlockTabs options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    npm run dev
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    yarn dev
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    pnpm dev
    ```
  </CodeBlockTabs>

  1. Visit your app's homepage at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
  1. Click "Sign up" in the header and authenticate to create your first user.

  ## It's time to build!

  You've added Clerk to your Next.js app ðŸŽ‰. From here, you can continue developing your application.

  To make configuration changes to your Clerk development instance, you can claim the Clerk keys that were generated for you. Claiming will associate these keys with your Clerk account, which you can create if you don't already have one.
